God woke up on the wrong side of bed this day
Therefore, he decided to manifest his wrath upon humans through his daughter Irma. 
He looked down upon the earth, seeing it slowly get swallowed in to a grip of chaos.
And decided that the only thing he currently liked about it was the Coca Cola Company.
And Pepsi is shite.
To get back on track, he decided to make a replica of the Coca Cola Company, in his kingdom called "Heaven".
And slowly let humanity devour it self, their reign of deadly sins.

A world of chaos was inevitable, for humanity. It was everyman for themselves, they had to prepare for a for a world without law, government and common sense.
God was definitely "a mean kid with a magnifying glass

BUT It turned out to be that it was just Stephen Lynch and a monkey high on LSD in a mall..!! While mormorns killed soldiers of justice AKA SJW!!

This is a story about that trip.
