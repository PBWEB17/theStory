Chapter One.

Once Satan came from the gates of Hell, he said that everyone should drink Dr. Pepper or burn in hell forever.
Satan looked like a 22 year old dude, with brown hair, a grey shirt, and a redish orange beanie.
He cast a terrible spell on a girl named Nanna, which made her incapable of typing a new line.
